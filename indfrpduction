          <h2>Water Awareness Project</h2>
          <p>Welcome to our Water Awareness Project.</p>
          <p>Clean water is essential to life. Our mission is to spread awareness about the importance of water conservation and ensure access to clean water for all.</p>
          <p>We believe that a brighter future starts with small steps: saving water, reducing pollution, and educating communities about sustainable practices. Through this platform, we aim to highlight challenges related to water scarcity and provide resources and solutions for a cleaner tomorrow.</p>
          <p>Together, let's make every drop count!</p>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>We are students of Geethanjali Institute of Science and Technology, from the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) department.</p>
          <p>As part of our Community Service Project (CSP), we chose Water Pollution Awareness as our domain. Our mission is to highlight the pressing issues related to water pollution and create awareness about its harmful effects on health and the environment.</p>
          <p>Over several weeks, we conducted detailed surveys in different localities, spoke to residents, documented water-related issues, and educated communities on clean water practices. We also performed pH tests to assess the quality of water in affected areas, collected feedback, and submitted detailed reports to the local Sachivalayam.</p>
          <p>This project gave us an opportunity to work closely with the community and understand real-world problems while contributing meaningfully to a cleaner, healthier society.</p>
          <p>We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to our beloved guide <strong>Dr. Sindhuri Nasina, Associate Professor, Ph.D</strong>, who supported us throughout this journey. Her valuable insights, continuous encouragement, and mentorship played a crucial role in the successful completion of our project.</p>

          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>Water pollution is a growing problem in areas like Ranganayakula Peta, Santhapeta and Mulapeta. In these localities, water sources such as canals, drains, and small ponds are getting polluted due to improper waste disposal, drainage leakage, and dumping of garbage.</p>
          <p>People living in these areas often use this water for daily needs, and polluted water is causing health problems like skin infections and stomach issues. The main causes of pollution here are household waste, plastic dumping, and sewage water mixing into fresh water sources.</p>
          <p>In this project, we studied the local water pollution problems and interacted with residents to understand their difficulties. Our goal is to spread awareness about water cleanliness and suggest solutions like proper drainage systems, avoiding plastic usage, and keeping surroundings clean.</p>
          <p>By taking small steps together, we can protect water and health in our communities.</p>
